# Chaotic Clock

This is a showcase of the API functionality of my Ingame Clock mod.
It positions the Clock randomly and changes color and scale of the clock randomly as well. 
Just for fun and mainly to show how to work with the API

## Building the Mod:

### Requirements
* [XMake](https://xmake.io) [2.8.2+]
* C++23 Compiler (MSVC, Clang-CL)

## Getting Started
```bat
git clone https://github.com/Styyx1/ChaoticClock --recursive
cd ChaoticClock
```

### Build
To build the project you first need to run the following command:
```bat
xmake build
```

> ***Note:*** *This will generate a `build/windows/` directory in the **project's root directory** with the build output.*

### Build Output (Optional)
If you want to redirect the build output, set one of or both of the following environment variables:

- Path to a Skyrim install folder: `XSE_TES5_GAME_PATH`

- Path to a Mod Manager mods folder: `XSE_TES5_MODS_PATH`

### Project Generation (Optional)
If you want to generate a Visual Studio project, run the following command:
```bat
xmake project -k vsxmake
```

> ***Note:*** *This will generate a `vsxmakeXXXX/` directory in the **project's root directory** using the latest version of Visual Studio installed on the system.*

### Upgrading Packages (Optional)
If you want to upgrade the project's dependencies, run the following commands:
```bat
xmake repo --update
xmake require --upgrade
```
